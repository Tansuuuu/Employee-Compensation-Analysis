# Employee-Compensation-Analysis

## Description

Utilizing Tableau to display and analyze the San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of the employee attrition, salary and benefits paid to City employees since 2013.

The main product of this report is the Tableau dashboard. This is an interactive dashboard that contains data focusing on employee salaries, benefits, overtime, and total compensation.

Dashboard link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tansu.ayaz/viz/EmployeeCompensationDashboard_16734660914110/Story1?publish=yes

The dashboard features:

- It seems that man and woman have sligtly the same salary and benefits.
- The number of employee has been an increase from 2013 to 2016. 
- There are beneficial outliers which means that when they stay for overtime they make more money. 
- If their compensation total is higher that's mean that their dental and health insurance is going to be higher too so, they will pay less money when they go to the doctor and less dudectable which is very good, and there is a positive correlation ship when they retired they will get a higher retirement.
- Chef invesment officer makes the highest hourly rate($247) because average salary is $60,00 so, their hourly is pretty higher than average.
- The most leaving job is transit operator with a rate of 26%.
- It seems that most of the transit power line job worker stay overtime.
- Public and health department provides the better salary and benefits.
